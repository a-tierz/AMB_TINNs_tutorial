# TINN_tutorial: A Guide to Thermodynamics-Informed Neural Networks
Welcome to the TINN_tutorial repository.
This tutorial is designed to help you understand and implement Thermodynamics-Informed Neural Networks (TINNs), a powerful framework that integrates thermodynamic principles with machine learning models. TINNs are particularly useful in cases where enforcing physical laws (such as energy conservation, entropy production, and thermodynamic consistency) can enhance the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization of neural networks.
