# TINN_tutorial: A Guide to Thermodynamics-Informed Neural Networks

## Overview
This project implements various neural network models designed to predict and simulate the dynamics of 
simple and double pendulum systems, with and without dissipation, using PyTorch Lightning. 
This tutorial is designed to help you understand and implement Thermodynamics-Informed Neural Networks 
(TINNs), a powerful framework that integrates thermodynamic principles with machine learning models. 
TINNs are particularly useful in cases where enforcing physical laws (such as energy conservation, 
entropy production, and thermodynamic consistency) can enhance the accuracy, interpretability, 
and generalization of neural networks.

The models employed include fully connected feedforward networks (MLPs) and TINNs for both reversible and dissipative systems.

The project is organized to provide:

- Black-box neural network models (e.g., BlackBox) to learn system dynamics from data.
- TINN-based models for learning structured dynamics with physical constraints, particularly for reversible and dissipative systems.
- Solvers for integrating the dynamics over time.

Models Implemented

- BlackBox: A simple feedforward neural network model for learning dynamics in a black-box fashion.
- TINN_01: A TINN model for reversible systems with a fixed skew-symmetric operator.
- TINN_02: A TINN model for reversible systems with a learnable skew-symmetric operator.
- TINN_03: A TINN model that incorporates dissipation using learnable symmetric and skew-symmetric operators.
- TINN: A fully learnable TINN model that learns both reversible and dissipative operators.

## Objectives
The goal is to learn system dynamics for the simple and double pendulum using:

- Energy conservation: For reversible systems, we aim to respect the conservation laws.
- Dissipative dynamics: For systems with dissipation, the models learn to dissipate energy correctly.
- Physical interpretability: Through structured models like TINNs, we attempt to incorporate physically meaningful structures into the neural networks.
